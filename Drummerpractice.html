    <h3>Don't hate.</h3>
    <p>As a drummer we have choices.  
       A kajillion differnt types of drum sets, and enough cymbals to blow out your shoulders. 
       My choice of drums are the <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/drums/ac_drums/drum_sets/absolute_hybrid_maple/index.html" target="_blank">Yamaha Absolute Maple</a> drums.
    <p>Why? because they sound so <strong>SWEET</strong>.  I am talking one of the most recording brand of drums in history.
    <p>A frequent question I hear is aren't they expensive?  <strong>YES</strong>, but they are worth every penny!</p>
    <p>I have included a link with my drum allowance <a href="#">Here</a>.  Really! did you think I would show you that? Silly, guitar player.</p>
    <p>So, now that we have the drums you need to buy, lets look at some cymbals to try out.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Zildjian</li>
            <li>Sabian</li>
            <li>Paiste</li>
            <li>Constantinople</li>
        </ol>
    <p>It is worth noting that cymbals are more a reflection of taste, the musical style/s you play in and the space you will play music in.</p>
    <p>You really should listen to some masters on the drum kit to get an idea of how bad you are before spending this kind of money on a full drum kit so head over to <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a> and check these players out.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vinnie Colaiuta</li>
            <li>Tommy Igoe</li>
            <li>Dave Weckl</li>
            <li>Gavin Harrison</li>
            <li>Steve SSSSSSmith</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Finally, we'll need something to beat with right?</p>
